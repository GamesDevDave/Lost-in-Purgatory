### Blank Unity Project ### 

This repository has been pre-configured with a .gitignore and .gitattributes file specific to Unity projects using git-lfs. 

This project was created for Unity 2019.4.1.f1.

The project has been created with a barebones folder structure and sample assets. The settings have been setup for URP. I would only reccomend using URP if you are developing for multiple platforms or if performance takes 
priority over quality.

For 2D projects use the defalt render pipeline repo found here https://gamesgit.falmouth.ac.uk/projects/GA/repos/blank-unity-project/browse

Please fork this repository, then rename and clone it to begin working on your project. 

Note:  Do not leave empty folders in your Unity project.  Empty folders do not get added to version control, but the meta files they create do.  This can lead to issues with keeping your project up to date.
